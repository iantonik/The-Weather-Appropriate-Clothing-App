# WeatherTastic App

An App that gives a recommendation of what to wear and pack based on the weather.

Imagine this: you are about to go on a trip to London for a few days and you need to pack. You have the basics down, the easy stuff like underwear and socks.  But what about all the hard stuff? Should you pack a jacket, or do you need a winter coat? Do you need an umbrella and rain boots? What if you could put in a location and dates into an app and it would give you a recommendation of what to wear and pack? What if you do not have an item on the recommended list, and you could just click a button and the app would take you to Amazon so you could buy it and get it delivered the next day?  Wouldn't that be fantastic?  We decided to solve that, and we built WeatherTastic.
